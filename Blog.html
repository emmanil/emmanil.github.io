    <h2 >Trying out the DAN prompt</h2 >
    <p >2023-02-18</p >
    <p >I enjoy prompt engineering with the AI language model chat gpt and during my break from writing an analysis (on cyber safety in my most recent project) I tried out the DAN prompt! As I enjoy politeness and kind text (even with AI, as it adapts to my tone) I simply had to try the DAN prompt and then ask about politeness. The response on my first question was impressive and nuanced!</p >
